## Notes
**Caution:**
_This can makes you losing faith in clean-coding, sometimes can cause social anxiety by watching these spaghettis for hours. Viewer discretion is advised._

\#1: **Spaghetti codes ahead**. These codes are for Judging System, not for Hooman Judging System. I added some comments, for debugging mostly, and I cannot guarantee that you understood it.

\#2: These algorithms __can__ output errors since sometimes problem's testcases are weak. [Feel free to report it here](https://github.com/trhgquan/CPP/issues)

\#3: If you are looking for documents (problem PDFs, problem solving in a nutshell, ..) please contact me: __*my email, in the first section.*__

\#4: Some problems come as .ZIP file, which contains problem's statements and sample source code in C/C++ and Pascal.

If you have a test tomorrow about algorithms, good luck. Keep calm, chilling and beat it!
