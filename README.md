I wrote those scripts, with examples from many sources: Quora, GeeksforGeeks, StackOverflow,..

My Grand Final Test was on Feb. 27th, 2019.

My result: __10/20 pts - Consolation, would do again__

If you are looking for some documents (problem PDFs, problem solving in a nutshell, ..) please contact me: __*my email, you know where, the left column, see?*__

Finally, if you are going to have *or* will have a Grand Final Test: hope you will find something useful in these files. Goodluck to you!
