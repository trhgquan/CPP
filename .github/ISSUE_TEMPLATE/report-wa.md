**Describe what is wrong!**
Have I made any mistakes? Do you recommend any solutions?

*Note: Always, __me__ is wrong first, then __you__ are wrong, then __both__ me and you are wrong and finally __there are no solutions for the problem__!*

Send me the problem's extra testcases if you want. Thanks!
