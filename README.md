## Notes
**Caution:**
_This can makes you losing faith in clean-coding, sometimes can cause social anxiety by watching these spaghettis for hours. Viewer discretion is advised._

\#1: **Spaghetti codes ahead**. These codes are for Online Judging System, not for Human Judging System. I added some comments, for debugging mostly, and I cannot guarantee that you understood it.

\#2: These algorithms __can__ output errors since sometimes problem's testcases are weak. [Feel free to report it here](https://github.com/trhgquan/CPP/issues)

\#3: For algorithm resources, visit [this link](https://chumeochuixoong.blogspot.com/p/resources.html).

\#4: Some problems might come as .ZIP file.

If you have a test tomorrow about algorithms, good luck. Keep calm, chill (_not chilling_) and beat it!
