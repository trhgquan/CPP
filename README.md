I wrote those scripts, with examples from many sources: Quora, GeeksforGeeks, StackOverflow,.. for those Final Tests.

## THE FIRST CHAPTER
Computer Science in Nguyen Dinh Chieu Highschool, Ben Tre Province, SR Vietnam.

My First Final Test was on Feb. 28th, 2018.  
My result: __*6.5/20* pts - Consolation__  
My Grand (and Second) Final Test was on Feb. 27th, 2019.  
My result: __*10/20* pts - 3rd__

## THE NEXT CHAPTER
Computer Science in the Ho Chi Minh University of Science (HCMUS), Hochiminh City, SR Vietnam.

*writing in progress, but in future*

If you are looking for some documents (problem PDFs, problem solving in a nutshell, ..) please contact me: __*my email, you know where, the left column, see?*__

Finally, if you are going to have *or* will have a Grand Final Test: hope you will find something useful in these files. Goodluck to you!
